### 1. How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
  In my approach to designing software, I focused on selecting objects that are commonly found in the real world, providing a variety of shapes and complexity. I considered the suitability of different primitive shapes for each object and how they can be combined to create representations that are recognizable to viewers. Additionally, I paid attention to geometry organization, polygon count, texturing, lighting, and object positioning. My design approach emphasized functionality, visual appearance, and user navigation.
  
  Working on this project has helped me develop several design skills. I have gained experience in selecting appropriate primitive shapes for different objects, organizing geometry, managing polygon count, applying textures accurately, implementing lighting using the Phong shading model, and creating user navigation controls. These skills have provided me with a foundation in 3D computer graphics and OpenGL, which can be applied to future projects in computer graphics, visualization, game development, and more.
  
- What design process did you follow for your project work?

  The design process for my project involved several steps. I started by selecting the objects for my 3D scene based on their real-world relevance and visual appeal. Then, I determined the primitive shapes to use for each object, considering their resemblance to the real-world objects and their simplicity in modeling and manipulation. I focused on maintaining a low polygon count and applied textures accurately to enhance visual appearance. Lighting was implemented using the Phong shading model. Finally, I implemented user navigation controls for exploring the scene using keyboard and mouse inputs.
  
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  The tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work involving computer graphics and visualization. The emphasis on selecting relevant objects, considering primitive shapes, organizing geometry, managing polygon count, and applying textures accurately can be utilized in various 3D projects. The implementation of lighting using shading models and the inclusion of user navigation controls can be adapted to create interactive 3D applications, virtual reality experiences, computer games, simulations, and more.
  
  ### 2. How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  In my approach to developing programs, I used tutorials and instructional videos to learn and apply the necessary concepts and functions. I focused on understanding and modifying existing code to suit my needs. I made sure the code was well-organized with appropriate spacing and comments, making it readable and comprehensible.
  
  While working on my 3D scene, I used several development strategies. You utilized tutorials and instructional videos to learn new concepts and functions. I focused on modularity, allowing for easy modification of camera positions, and vertices. I also made adjustments and improvements throughout the development process. Moreover, I followed coding best practices by organizing the code with appropriate spacing and comments, enhancing its readability and comprehension.
  
- How did iteration factor into your development?

  Iteration played an important role in my development process. I made adjustments and improvements throughout the development of my 3D scene. As I progressed through the course, I  encountered challenges and identified areas for enhancement. Through iteration, I was able to refine the code, improve functionality, adjust object positioning, fine-tune lighting, and ensure a realistic representation of materials. Iteration allowed me to incrementally improve my project and address any issues or limitations that arose during the development process.
  
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  Throughout the milestones of my project, my approach to developing code has evolved. Initially, I relied more on tutorials and instructional videos to gain foundational knowledge and learn basic concepts. As I progressed in the course, I gained confidence in understanding the code and began making modifications to suit my specific needs. My approach became more independent, with a focus on understanding and altering existing code rather than relying solely on external resources. Additionally, I developed an approach to organize code, incorporate comments and spacing to enhance readability and comprehension.
  
### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
